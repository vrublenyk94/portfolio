          My journey as a front-end developer began about a year and a half ago,
          driven by a passion for creating and learning. I started immersing
          myself in the world of coding while living in Poland, where I dove
          into the basics of front-end development and began honing my skills.

          Determined to expand my horizons and challenge myself further, I moved
          to the UK to pursue my dream of becoming a front-end developer.
          Despite being relatively new to the field, I embraced every
          opportunity to learn and grow. My dedication to mastering new
          technologies and my unwavering commitment to improvement have been the
          cornerstones of my journey so far.

          Over the past year, I've been building my expertise through various
          projects and learning experiences, constantly pushing myself to
          achieve a higher level of proficiency. My perseverance and hard work
          have led me to interviews with Ukrainian IT companies, where Iâ€™ve been
          able to showcase my skills and passion.

          Now, I am eager to find a full-time position in the UK where I can
          contribute my skills, continue to learn, and grow professionally. I'm
          excited about the possibilities and committed to bringing my best to
          every opportunity that comes my way. I truly love what I do and am
          looking forward to the next chapter in my career!
